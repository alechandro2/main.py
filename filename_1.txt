Yellow Submarine

In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines
So we sailed on to the sun
Till we found a sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

[Full speed ahead, Mr. Boatswain, full speed ahead
Full speed ahead it is, Sir
Cut the cable, drop the cable
Aye-aye, Sir, aye-aye
Captain, captain]

As we live a life of ease
Every one of us [every one of us] has all we need [has all we need]
Sky of blue [sky of blue] and sea of green [sea of green]
In our yellow [in our yellow] submarine [submarine, a-ha!]

We all live in a yellow submarine
A yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
A yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarineâ€¦
